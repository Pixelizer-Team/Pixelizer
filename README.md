![R=5](samples/pixelized_5.jpg)
Pixelized with Radius = 15
![R=15](samples/pixelized_15.jpg)
Pixelized with Radius = 30
![R=30](samples/pixelized_30.jpg)


### Requirements
Python 3+

You will need Numpy, Pillow, Shapely, and Tqdm to run this code.
You can install the requirements easily using 
```bash
